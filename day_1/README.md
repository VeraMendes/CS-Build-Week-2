## Contains Duplicates
Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.
Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

```Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: true```

Example 2:

```Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: false```

Example 3:

```Input: [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true```


## Add Two Numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

```Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807```
